OpenAI has a python completions api that you can call like:

import os
import openai
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)

In our own code, please use model 'gpt-4' instead of 'gpt-3.5-turbo'.

The 'content' field here is called the 'prompt'.

The res object looks like:

{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "\n\nHello there, how may I assist you today?",
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "completion_tokens": 12,
    "total_tokens": 21
  }
}

The completion is the value of the 'content' field.

Please create a website, using python aiohttp and React, which will create an interface where a user can type in a prompt, into a multiline text field, and the completion will display in a second multiline text field underneath, when the user clicks a 'submit' button.

Please use a 'single page application', using React.

Make sure I dont get any errors like
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/chat' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
```
or:
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8080/chat' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.
```
or:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-modal' in '/Users/hugh/git/scalable-gpt-developer/test_app_react/src'
```

Sometimes the completion will contain files, which will be formatted something like:

[some_file_name].py
```python
the file contents goes here
```

The exact filename will vary, and you will need to extract it from the text.
When such files exist, please do not display these files in the completion text box. Instead, please create a list of filenames on the left. If I click on one of these filenames, the contents will show in a modal window, with a scrollbar. I should be able to easily click into the window, use ctrl-a to select all, then ctrl-c to copy the contents of the file. The remainder of the completion should still be shown, separately.
